    'intro' => 'We are not the largest agency in the country, but we are definitely the most colorful team of professionals and enthusiasts in the advertising world of Serbia. We are part of the global FCB network which for 140 years now has been changing how brands find their way to consumers. We have been doing that for “only” 20 years to mutual satisfaction – our clients’, and our own.
We are the center of all FCB agencies in the Balkan region (Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia&Herzegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania).
So, we are big enough to enable regional support even to the world’s largest brands, but small enough to stay simple, familiar, hearty and outgiving to the client.
<br><i>Our strategy is to always have serious strategy for each and every brand, and what advertises our work best is our best advertising work.</i>
